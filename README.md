# Disable WordPress RSS Feeds

## Overview
This repository provides a simple, yet powerful, function to disable WordPress RSS feeds that are displayed by default. The primary purpose of this function is to enhance the security of your WordPress site.

## Features
The function in this repository disables all types of WordPress feeds, including:

  * Main posts feed
  * Comments feed
  * Category feeds

When any of these feeds are requested, the server will return a 404 page. This gives the impression that the feed does not exist, further discouraging potential hackers.

## Why Disable RSS Feeds?

Hackers scan WordPress sites on a regular basis. The RSS feeds that are automatically generated by WordPress can leak sensitive information, such as:

  * The version of WordPress in use
  * The names of the content authors

If the WordPress version hasn't been updated after a known security breach, a hacker could use this information to carry out an attack. Moreover, if the hacker knows the usernames used to access the admin page, they could perform a brute force attack (via wp-login.php). Weak passwords can be cracked within hours using this method.

## Considerations

Please note that disabling RSS feeds will make your content unavailable to any service or tool that uses these feeds (e.g., Feedly). If your site relies on such services, you should consider the implications before implementing this change.

## How to Use
1. Download the `functions.php` file in this repository.
2. Add the contents of this file to your WordPress theme's `functions.php` file. Make sure to add it within the PHP tags.
