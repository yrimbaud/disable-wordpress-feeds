# Disable WordPress RSS feeds

Short function that disables WordPress RSS feeds displayed by default.

The function disables all types of feeds, including:
- the main posts feed
- the comments feed
- the category feeds.

When any of these feeds are requested, the server will return a 404 page, making it seem like the feed does not exist.

Hackers scan WordPress sites on a regular basis. RSS feeds automatically generated by WordPress indicate the version of WordPress in use as well as the names of the content authors.

If the WordPress version has not been updated after a known security breach, a hacker could exploit this information to carry out an attack.

If the hacker knows the usernames used to access the admin page, a hacker can perform a brute force attack (via wp-login.php). Weak passwords can be found in hours.

Please remember that disabling RSS feeds will make your content unavailable to any service or tool that uses these feeds (e.g. Feedly). Make sure this is the effect you want before implementing this change.
